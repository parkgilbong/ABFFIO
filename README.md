# ABFFIO
LabVIEW APIs for reading ABF files

Axon Binary Format (ABF) files are generated by Clampex (Molecular Devices). This file contains electrophysiological data. The one who wanna approach to abf file using a third-party application should utilize a 32-bit Windows-only DLL (abffio.dll), which is not familiar for me. I tried to extract meaningful information from abf files without relying on a DLL. Several attempts have been made to import abf files into Python (done by Scott Harden) and R program (done by Matthew Caldwell). I converted these python and R codes to LabVIEW APIs.
